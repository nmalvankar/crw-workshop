=== What is CodeReady Workspaces?

Built on the open Eclipse Che project, Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces uses Kubernetes and containers to provide any member of the development or IT team with a consistent, secure, and zero-configuration development environment. The experience is as fast and familiar as an integrated development environment on your laptop.

Read more about it in the https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview[CodeReady Workspaces documentation^]

== Lab 1 - Explore CodeReady Workspaces

=== 1. Access Your Development Environment

You will be using Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces, an online IDE based on https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse
Che^]. *Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds*, so you don’t need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, access the CodeReady Workspaces instance and log in using the username
and password you’ve been assigned (e.g. `{{ USER_ID }}/{{ CHE_USER_PASSWORD }}`):

image::che-login.png[cdw, 700]

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on your personal dashboard. Create a new workspace using the following github URL.

image::crw-landing.png[cdw, 700]

You can also click on the name of the workspace in the center, and then click on the green {{ USER_ID}}-namespace that says _Open_ on the top right hand side of the screen:

image::crw-landing-start.png[cdw, 700]

After a minute or two, you’ll be placed in the workspace:

image::che-workspace.png[cdw, 900]

This IDE is based on Eclipse Che (which is in turn based on Microsoft VS Code editor).

You can see icons on the left for navigating between project explorer, search, version control (e.g. Git), debugging, and other plugins.  You’ll use these during the course of this workshop. Feel free to click on them and see what they do:

image::crw-icons.png[cdw, 400]

[NOTE]
====
If things get weird or your browser appears, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.
====

Many features of CodeReady Workspaces are accessed via *Commands*. You can see a few of the commands listed with links on the home page (e.g. _New File.._, _Git Clone.._, and others).

If you ever need to run commands that you don't see in a menu, you can press kbd:[F1] to open the command window, or the more traditional kbd:[Control+SHIFT+P] (or kbd:[Command+SHIFT+P] on Mac OS X).

Let's import our first project. Click on **Git Clone..** (or type kbd:[F1], enter 'git' and click on the auto-completed _Git Clone.._ )

image::che-workspace-gitclone.png[cdw, 900]

Step through the prompts, using the following value for **Repository URL**. If you use *FireFox*, it may end up pasting extra spaces at the end, so just press backspace after pasting:

[source,none,role="copypaste"]
----
https://github.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs.git
----

image::crw-clone-repo.png[crw,900]

Ensure `projects/` is selected, then click on *Select Repository Location* then click on *Open*:

image::crw-add-workspace-2.png[crw, 900]

Note that you probably need to reload your web browser to load the new workspace.

The project is imported into your workspace and is visible in the project explorer (collapse the *OPEN EDITORS*):

image::crw-clone-explorer.png[crw,900]

==== IMPORTANT: Check out proper Git branch

To make sure you're using the right version of the project files, run this command in a CodeReady Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cd $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs && git checkout ocp-4.8
----

[NOTE]
====
The Terminal window in CodeReady Workspaces. You can open a terminal window for any of the containers running in your Developer workspace. For the rest of these labs, anytime you need to run a command in a terminal, you can use the **>_ New Terminal** command on the right:

= Lab3 - Debugging Applications
:experimental:
:imagesdir: images

In this lab, you will debug the coolstore microservice application using Java remote debugging and look into line-by-line code execution as the code runs on Quarkus.

==== 1. Enable Remote Debugging

Remote debugging is a useful debugging technique for application development which allows looking into the code that is being executed somewhere else on a different machine and execute the code line-by-line to help investigate bugs and issues. Remote debugging is part of Java SE standard debugging architecture which you can learn more about it in https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/architecture.html[Java SE docs^].

Quarkus in development mode enables "Live Coding" with background compilation, which means that when you modify your Java files and/or your resource files and refresh your browser, these changes will automatically take effect. This works too for resource files like the configuration properties files and even `pom.xml` changes.

When run in Developer Mode (i.e. `mvn quarkus:dev`), Quarkus will also listen for debugging sessions on port `5005` (by default). If your want to wait for the debugger to attach before running you can pass `-Ddebug` on the command line. If you don’t want the debugger at all you can use `-Ddebug=false`.

Start up the Inventory microservice locally, in development mode, using this command in a CodeReady Terminal:
Enable remote debugging on Inventory by running the following command in the CodeReady Workspaces Terminal window:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0 -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs/inventory
----

You should see a bunch of log output that ends with:

[source,console]
----
__  ____  __  _____   ___  __ ____  ______

--
Tests paused
Press [r] to resume testing, [o] Toggle test output, [h] for more options>
----

You can see *Tests paused* by default when a Quarkus application gets started.

[NOTE]
====
Close any popups about port 5005 or 8080 when the app starts up
====

===== Controlling Continuous Testing

There are various hotkeys you can use to control continuous testing. Pressing `h` will display the following list of commands in the terminal:

[source, none]
----
== Continuous Testing

[r] - Re-run all tests
[f] - Re-run failed tests
[b] - Toggle 'broken only' mode, where only failing tests are run (disabled)
[v] - Print failures from the last test run
[p] - Pause tests
[o] - Toggle test output (disabled)
----

Quarkus also provides a new experimental Dev UI, which is available in dev mode (when you start quarkus with mvn quarkus:dev) at `/q/dev` by default. It allows you to quickly visualize all the extensions currently loaded, see their status and go directly to their documentation.

Click on `quarkus-devui` endpoint:

image::devui-endpoint.png[devui-endpoint, 700]

A new web browser will open automatically then it will show you something like this:

image::quarkus-devui.png[devui-endpoint, 800]

You are all set now to start debugging using the tools of you choice.

Do not wait for the command to return! The Quarkus maven plugin keeps the forwarded port open so that you can start debugging remotely.

image::debug-che-quarkus.png[Quarkus Debug, 700]

==== 2. Add a bug

Let's add a new endpoint that has a bug we will fix using the debugger.

Go back to the _Explorer_ view, and under the `cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs` project, open the `inventory/src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/InventoryResource.java` file. Add a new method which has an off-by-one error:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
    @GET
    @Path("/lastletter/{itemId}")
    @Produces("application/text-plain")
    public String lastLetter(@PathParam("itemId") String itemId) {
        Inventory item = Inventory.find("itemId", itemId).firstResult();
        String location = item.location;
        int len = location.length();
        String lastLetter = location.substring(len);
        return lastLetter;
    }
----

This method retrieves the location of inventory, and outputs the last letter in the name of the location. After adding this method, try it out with item `165613`, which has inventory in `Seoul` and we'd expect the last letter `l` to be output. Open another Terminal and run the command:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/services/inventory/lastletter/165613
----

You don't see the letter `l` do you? You should see:

image::debug-che-quarkus-lastletter.png[Quarkus Debug, 700]

There's no `l`! You can probably spot the error, but let's walk through the debugger.

==== 2. Debug with CodeReady Workspaces

Click on the Debug icon on the left, select _Attach to App_ in the drop-down, and click the green _Start Debugging_ Icon:

image::debug-che-quarkus-attach.png[Quarkus Debug, 700]

You may see `[Warn] The debugger and the debuggee are running in different versions of JVMs. You could see wrong source mapping results.` You can ignore this warning, as long as the JVM versions are in the same major version family it won't be a problem.

You should see a list of Threads in the debug console.

[WARNING]
====
**If you get errors or strange messages about Java Language Server or other failures**, you may need to restart the Java Language Server. To do this, press kbd:[F1] to open the command window, or the more traditional kbd:[Control+SHIFT+P] (or kbd:[Command+SHIFT+P] on Mac OS X). You can also use the *View > Find Command...*. Type `java` and click on the command named *Java: Clean the Java language server workspace* as shown:

image::clean-jls.png[JLS, 900]

This will restart the Java language server. Once it's restarted and you're back in your workspace, click the _Attach to App_ green icon once again to attach the debugger and proceed below.
====

Go back to the _Explorer_ view. In the new method you added, add a breakpoint by clicking to the left of the first line in that method to cause a red dot to appear, as shown:

image::debug-che-breakpoint.png[Add Breakpoint, 700]

Open a new Terminal and invoke the new method using the same `curl` command:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/services/inventory/lastletter/165613
----

This command will appear to hang, while the debugger intercepts the call. Switch back to the Debugger view to see the state:

image::debug-che-breakpoint-hit.png[Add Breakpoint, 700]

Click on the _Step Over_ icon to execute one line and retrieve the inventory object for the given product id from the database and see the yellow cursor advance one line.

Expand the _Local Variables_ in the lower left, to see the variables for `itemId` passed to the method and `item` element retrieved from the database. If you don't see them, click on the small arrow next to _Locals_ to expand the list.

image::debug-che-step-over.png[Step Over, 900]

Step over 2 more times, and note the value of `location` is `Seoul` and `len` is set to the length of `Seoul` which is `5`.

image::debug-che-step-over2.png[Step Over, 600]

One more step-over, and you can clearly see that `lastLetter` is blank (empty string). It's an off-by-one error!

image::debug-che-error.png[Step Over, 800]

Click the Continue button to let the method finish and return the empty value to `curl`:

image::debug-che-continue.png[Step Over, 600]

==== 3. Fix and Confirm

The off-by-one error can be fixed simply by fixing the call to `substring()`. Fix the bug by changing the line with `substring()` to read:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
        String lastLetter = location.substring(len - 1);
----

Execute the command again:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/services/inventory/lastletter/165613
----

The debugger will again catch the execution. Step through with the debugger as you did previously and confirm the value of `lastLetter` is `l` and is properly returned when the method is finished:

image::debug-che-final2.png[Step Over, 1000]

[NOTE]
====
Click on the _Stop Debugger_ (red box) to disconnect the debugger, then stop the app by typing kbd:[CTRL-C] in the Terminal in which the app runs.
====

==== Congratulations!

Quarkus apps are just like any other Java app, so debugging is straightforward and supported by many IDEs and CLIs out there. Combined with Live Reload and CodeReady Workspaces, it makes development quick and (relatively) painless!
