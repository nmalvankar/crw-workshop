== What is CodeReady Workspaces?

Built on the open Eclipse Che project, Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces uses Kubernetes and containers to provide any member of the development or IT team with a consistent, secure, and zero-configuration development environment. The experience is as fast and familiar as an integrated development environment on your laptop.

Read more about it in the https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview[CodeReady Workspaces documentation^]

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on your personal dashboard. 

image::crw-landing.png[cdw, 700]

You can also click on the name of the workspace in the center, and then click on the green {{ USER_ID}}-namespace that says _Open_ on the top right hand side of the screen:

image::crw-landing-start.png[cdw, 700]

After a minute or two, you’ll be placed in the workspace:

image::che-workspace.png[cdw, 900]

This IDE is based on Eclipse Che.

You can see icons on the left for navigating between project explorer, search, version control (e.g. Git), debugging, and other plugins.  You’ll use these during the course of this workshop. Feel free to click on them and see what they do:

[NOTE]
====
If things get weird or your browser appears, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.
====

Many features of CodeReady Workspaces are accessed via *Commands*. You can see a few of the commands listed with links on the home page (e.g. _New File.._, _Git Clone.._, and others).

If you ever need to run commands that you don't see in a menu, you can press kbd:[F1] to open the command window, or the more traditional kbd:[Control+SHIFT+P] (or kbd:[Command+SHIFT+P] on Mac OS X).


Let's go back to the dashboard by clicking on the chevron (enclosed in yellow rectangle) on the top left side of the screen and create a new workspace using the following github URL.

----
https://github.com/nmalvankar/quarkus-reactjs-postit-app.git
----

image::lab1_create_new_workspace.png[cdw, 700]


Click on Create & Open


You can check the progress of your workspace as shown below

image::lab1_progress.png[cdw, 700]


You can also check the logs for more details 

image::lab1_log.png[cdw, 700]


The project is imported into your workspace and is visible in the project explorer (collapse the *OPEN EDITORS*):

image::crw-clone-explorer.png[crw,900]

==== IMPORTANT: Check out proper Git branch

To make sure you're using the right version of the project files, run this command in a CodeReady Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cd $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-reactjs-postit-app && git checkout master
----

[NOTE]
====
The Terminal window in CodeReady Workspaces. You can open a terminal window for any of the containers running in your Developer workspace. For the rest of these labs, anytime you need to run a command in a terminal, you can use the **>_ New Terminal** command on the right:

== Lab 2 - Developing with CodeReady Workspaces 

==== 1. Search a Java file

Now the workspace has been started and loaded, I have all the tools that I need, as a developer to start working on the project.

image::lab2_workspace_home.png[workspace_home, 900]

Press F1 to open the command palette, that works exactly the same way as in VisualStudio Code

image::lab2_workspace_palette.png[workspace_palette, 900]

Remove the `>` to search for a file. Search for the file “Post.java” and click “enter” in the command palette to open it. 

image::lab2_workspace_searchfile.png[workspace_search, 900]

==== 2. Start the application in devmode

The demo Post it application is composed of

a. Java backend using Quarkus,
b. Nodejs/Reactjs frontend and
c. Mongodb database

The mongodb database has already been started when the workspace started. It’s one of the components of the workspace.

==== Start the Quarkus backend
Let’s open the “Workspace Panel”: Go on the right sidebar and click on the last item of the sidebar

image::lab2_start_commands.png[lab2_start_commands, 900]

In the list of components, go on “quarkus-backend-dev” and click on the task “Start DEVMODE quarkus-backend”. 

image::lab2_start_quarkus_backend.png[lab2_start_quarkus_backend, 900]

The quarkus-backend is starting and CodeReady Workspaces is displaying a notification showing there is a new process running in the workspace and asking if we want to open it. 

[TIP]
======
Click only once on the command task
======

image::lab2_start_quarkus_backend.png[lab2_start_quarkus_backend, 900]

The quarkus-backend is starting and CodeReady Workspaces is displaying a notification showing there is a new process running in the workspace and asking if we want to open it. 

image::lab2_open_quarkuslink.png[lab2_open_quarkuslink, 900]


Click on “Open Link”. 

Inside of the editor, a new panel is displayed showing the quarkus-backend component running. At this stage, it is empty. 

image::lab2_quarkus_preview.png[lab2_quarkus_preview, 900]

At this stage the backend service is running and connected to the mongodb database. 

==== Let’s start the frontend
Let’s go back to the “Workspace Panel”
In the list of component, go on “node-frontend-dev” and click on the task “Start DEV node-frontend”.

PS: Alternatively, you can run “Start PROD node-frontend” that will run a prebuilt version of the frontend (faster but won’t take any live changes).

image::lab2_frontend_command.png[lab2_quarkus_preview, 900]

[TIP]
======
Click only once on the command task
======

The node-frontend is starting and CodeReady Workspaces is displaying a notification showing that there is a new process running in the workspace and asking if we want to open it. 

image::lab2_frontend_url.png[lab2_quarkus_preview, 900]

Click on “Open Link”. 

Inside the editor, the preview panel is now the frontend. It shows a form with an empty list of post items. It is possible to add new post items by filling the form.

At this stage, the frontend is running and connected to the quarkus backend. The quarkus backend is started in devmode which allows to provide livereload and opening the debug port.

==== Lets add a few post items

image::lab2_add_postitems.png[lab2_quarkus_preview, 900]


==== Let’s try to set the title of each post in uppercase. 

Reopen quarkus-backend > Post.java.
In the `getTitle()` method, use the code completion to set the title in uppercase.
After `return title`, type `.upper` and the code completion will suggest `toUpperCase()`. Select it.

image::lab2_codecompletion.png[lab2_quarkus_preview, 900]

If needed, use `Ctrl-space` to retrigger the code completion.

Refresh the preview pane: All the titles of post items are now in uppercase.

[#lab_3]
== Lab 3 - Debugging Applications

In this lab, you will debug the coolstore microservice application using Java remote debugging and look into line-by-line code execution as the code runs on Quarkus.

==== 1. Enable Remote Debugging

Remote debugging is a useful debugging technique for application development which allows looking into the code that is being executed somewhere else on a different machine and execute the code line-by-line to help investigate bugs and issues. Remote debugging is part of Java SE standard debugging architecture which you can learn more about it in https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/architecture.html[Java SE docs^].

Quarkus in development mode enables "Live Coding" with background compilation, which means that when you modify your Java files and/or your resource files and refresh your browser, these changes will automatically take effect. This works too for resource files like the configuration properties files and even `pom.xml` changes.

When run in Developer Mode (i.e. `mvn quarkus:dev`), Quarkus will also listen for debugging sessions on port `5005` (by default). If your want to wait for the debugger to attach before running you can pass `-Ddebug` on the command line. If you don’t want the debugger at all you can use `-Ddebug=false`.

==== 2. Add a breakpoint to debug the application.

Let's add a new endpoint in the ‘getContent()’ method of Post.java (line 31)

image::lab2_quarkus_breakpoint.png[lab2_quarkus_preview, 900]

Start the debug mode from the top menu ‘Debug’ > ‘Start Debugging’. CodeReady Workspaces is opening the debug pane.

image::lab2_startdebugging.png[lab2_quarkus_preview, 900]

Refresh the preview pane. CodeReady Workspaces is stopping at the break point.

image::lab2_debug_refresh.png[lab2_quarkus_preview, 900]


In the debug pane, in the local variable (should be done quickly to avoid timeout), double click on `content: “World”`

image::lab2_debug_highlight.png[lab2_quarkus_preview, 900]

Edit the value of the content, for instance the location where you are.

image::lab2_debug_editvalue.png[lab2_quarkus_preview, 900]

Validate `OK`

Continue (play button)

image::lab2_debug_play.png[lab2_quarkus_preview, 900]

The content should have been changed

image::lab2_debug_newvalue.png[lab2_quarkus_preview, 900]


==== Congratulations!

You have successfully run the Postit application locally and debugged the application using remote debugging

[#lab_4]
== Lab 4 - CodeReady Workspaces Plugins

A Che-Theia plug-in is an extension of the development environment isolated from the IDE. Plug-ins can be packaged as files or containers to provide their own dependencies.

Extending Che-Theia using plug-ins can enable the following capabilities:

Language support: Extend the supported languages by relying on the Language Server Protocol.
Debuggers: Extend debugging capabilities with the Debug Adapter Protocol.
Development Tools: Integrate your favorite linters, and as testing and performance tools.
Menus, panels, and commands: Add your own items to the IDE components.
Themes: Build custom themes, extend the UI, or customize icon themes.
Snippets, formatters, and syntax highlighting: Enhance comfort of use with supported programming languages.
Keybindings: Add new keymaps and popular keybindings to make the environment feel natural.

You can checkout the plugins at View > Plugins

image::lab4_plugins.png[Plugins, 900]

For checking out the installed plugins, enter "@installed" in the text box 

image::lab4_installed_plugins.png[Installed Plugins, 900]

You can also install a plugin thats available in the list of plugins for your workspace. 

image::lab4_avail_plugins.png[Available Plugins, 900]

You may be prompted to restart the workspace for the plugin to be activated as shown below

image::lab4_restart_workspace.png[Restart workspace, 900]



Once you restart the workspace, the plugin should be ready for use


[NOTE]
======
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions can be installed to extend the functionality of a CodeReady Workspaces workspace. VS Code extensions can run in the Che-Theia editor container, or they can be packaged in their own isolated and pre-configured containers with their prerequisites.

These plug-ins can be added to the plug-in registry, then easily reused by anyone in the same organization with access to that workspaces installation.
